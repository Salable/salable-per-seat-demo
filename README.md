## Demo

[View Hosted Demo](https://seats-demo.vercel.app/)

The product in the demo generates strings with random data which vary in size
based on the number of bytes selected. To get access to the product a user must
sign up and subscribe to a plan. The byte sizes for the strings are feature
locked behind different plans. Once a user has subscribed they will be able
access some or all of these features depending on what plan they are licensed
on.

The email of the sign up does not have to be real, this is just for demo
purposes.

The demo is integrated with Stripe to handle payments and is running in test
mode so a fake/demonstration card can be used.

### Demo Card Details

**Card Number**: `4242 4242 4242 4242` \
**Expiry Date**: Any future date (`09/42`) \
**CVC**: Any 3 digit number (`123`) \
**Cardholder Name**: Anything (`Mr John Doe`)

## Auth

User details are stored in the Turso database, and passwords are securely hashed
with unique salts. The ID of the logged-in user is used as the `granteeId` when
creating a license on Salable. It is also used for the license checks. If you're
developing an app within an existing ecosystem like Trello or Slack, you can
swap out the included authentication system with theirs.
